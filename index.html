        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The huge variety of resources available to you as a student of UW-Madison is one of the best things about
            being here. It's also one of the biggest challenges! Keeping up with your course work is hard enough, let
            alone staying current with all of the different services, tools, and technologies that are available to you
            as a student. </p>
        <p>This list is just a handful of the tools, services, and offerings that can help you succeed in your time at
            UW-Madison. It includes both UW-Madison specific services and tools as well as others that may not be
            officially supported by DoIT.</p>
        <h2>Browser Extensions</h2>
        <p>Many of the tools in this guide offer <em>browser extensions</em> to provide their features and
            functionality. These are small bits of software that you can install in your web browser of choice (e.g.
            Chrome, Firefox, Safari) that enable extra functionality beyond the default browser experience.</p>
        <p>These are usually free of charge, are straightforward to install, and can be found via internet search or by
            browsing the extension galleries for each respective browser:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Firefox Add-Ons</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://safari-extensions.apple.com" target="_blank">Safari Extensions Gallery</a></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="important center">
            <p>It's best to avoid installing browser extensions from anywhere other than the official collections. It is
                possible for unscrupulous people and companies to add malware, trackers, and other harmful code to
                browser extensions that come from external sources.</p>
            <p>The official repositories monitor extensions for this type of malware, but untrusted, unofficial sources
                may not - they may even add their own!</p>

            If you are looking for a specific software program or topic, try searching for "[software] essentials", e.g.
            "photoshop essentials". The Essentials video series usually provide a good introduction to the programs
            without getting too complicated.
        </div>
        <p>The huge amount of content is a great resource but can make it hard to know where to start.</p>

        <h2>Canvas</h2>
        <p>Canvas is the official Learning Management System (LMS) used by UW-Madison. It is used by instructors to post
            course content for their academic classes as well as by groups like STS for non-academic purposes.</p>
        <p>The interface is pretty intuitive, but it can sometimes be hard to know where to find things in a course
            because instructors can customize them in a variety of ways. One instructor might organize readings, videos,
            and quizzes into Modules by class topic, while another instructor might not use Modules at all. </p>
        <p>If you ever need help figuring out how to use Canvas, <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/13"
                target="_blank">the Canvas training course for Students</a> gives a good overview of how it works, and

        <p>Unlimited file storage and sharing, with excellent real-time collaboration/editing plus easy sharing with
            anyone on or off campus. You can upload files from your local computer for storage in the cloud and access
            them anywhere you can get online.</p>
        <p>Drive also features Google Apps (aka G Suite), which is Google's suite of productivity tools.</p>
        <img class="border rounded shadow  float-right" src="images/14-drive.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Drive">
        <p>There are a variety of tools in Drive, but the ones that are most commonly used on campus include the

        </p>

        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent collaboration, unlimited storage, campus-supported, offers local file
            syncing</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> must be online to use, is tied to your NetID (meaning your files are no longer
